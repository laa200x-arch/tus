echo ============================================================
echo  PUSH FAILED - common causes:
echo   1. The repo does not exist yet:
echo        https://github.com/new  ->  name: %REPO%
echo      (do NOT check "Add a README file")
echo      then run this file again.
echo   2. You named the repo differently: edit "set REPO=" above.
echo   3. GitHub login window was cancelled: run again.
echo   4. Repo already has a README (created by GitHub): run
echo        git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
echo      then run this file again.
